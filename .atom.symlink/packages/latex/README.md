# LaTeX package [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thomasjo/atom-latex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thomasjo/atom-latex)
A simple package for Atom that compiles LaTeX files by invoking Latexmk.

## Installing
Use the Atom package manager and search for "latex", or run `apm install latex`
from the command line.

## Prerequisites
### TeX distribution
Since this package relies upon `latexmk`, a fully updated and working TeX
distribution is required. The only current officially supported distribution is
[TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), but [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) has
been reported to work.

You need to ensure that the package can find your TeX distribution; if you're
using TeX Live and have installed to the default location then no further
action should be required. To help the package find the distribution's
binaries, you need to configure the *TeX Path* configuration variable to point
to the folder containing the binaries. This can be done either in the settings
view, or directly in your `config.cson` file.

## Usage
Invoke the `build` command by pressing the default keybind `ctrl-alt-b` while in
a `.tex` file.

## Status
Please note that this package is in a **beta** state. Right now everything is
very na√Øve. As an example, there's no proper error and warning handling.

## TODO
Current wish list, in a semi-prioritized order.

- [x] Progress indicator.
- [ ] Build output.
  - [x] Error handling.
  - [ ] Warnings, and other non-critical messages.
- [ ] BibTeX autocompletion support.
- [x] Open PDF automatically.
  - [x] Configurable.
  - [x] Support for other distributions, besides OS X.
  - [x] Support for custom PDF viewer.
- [ ] Support for compilers other than latexmk.
  - [x] Partially supported via the "Builder" concept, but no alternative
    implementations have been created.
  - [x] Support for texify compiler (MiKTeX).
  - [ ] Add support for non-PDF typesetting (e.g. dvi).
- [ ] Project management.
  - [ ] Setting to override the output directory.
  - [ ] Setting to override the builder.
